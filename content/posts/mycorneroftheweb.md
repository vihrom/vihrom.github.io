Hey there! This is my little corner of the internet—just a personal blog where I'll be sharing my journey of learning to code. No algorithms, no engagement farming, just a good old-fashioned place for thoughts, experiments, and whatever else I feel like posting.

I’ve always loved the spirit of the early web—Web 1.0—when everyone had their own weird, quirky little websites. A time before everything got swallowed up by walled gardens like Telegram, Twitter, and a million other closed platforms. I miss when the internet felt like a vast, chaotic city instead of a handful of corporate shopping malls.

So, I’m doing my small part to bring that vibe back. No paywalls, no "Like and Subscribe" buttons—just a blog. My blog. Welcome aboard!
